# Tea-Cozy (CodeAcademy)

In this project, I will be creating a fictional tea shop website.
Design spec and image assets were provided to help me along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that I am be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.
